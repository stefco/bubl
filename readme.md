# Friend Bubbler

Keep track of my friends and remind me to organize hangouts using a command
line interface.

Track the following:

- [ ] Last hangout with a friend
- [ ] Show friends I have gone longest without seeing
- [ ] Show friends I am currently trying to schedule a hangout with
- [ ] Track tentative plans as events
- [ ] Track completed plans

So, I need a class describing a hangout. And I need a database of past
hangouts. Seems like that is all. Maybe the hangout concept also requires a
"medium" or "activity" so that e.g. substantive phone calls can count? Should
at least include some sort of communication, in case I just want to get in
touch with someone.

- Track friends I want to keep seeing
- Track friends I want to keep messaging/calling
- Track current plans I want to make
